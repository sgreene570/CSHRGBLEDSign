WIP Networked RGB LEDs using Flask and the pi-blaster library.
Uses iButtons to access an LDAP server to find a .colors configuration in user homedirs.
Uses flask and flask limiter to handle http requests properly.
Colorhandler.py probably needs to run as sudo to access the Pi GPIO pins.
For CSH members, see the wiki to learn more about current configurations.
